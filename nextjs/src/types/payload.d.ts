/**
 * `PayloadHeading` is a versatile heading component for displaying titles with various styles.
 * It accepts a `title` prop which is the content of the heading, and a `variant` prop which determines the style of the heading.
 * The `variant` can be one of "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", "h6", "p", or "b", corresponding to the respective HTML elements.
 *
 * Optionally, an `icon` can be passed which is displayed next to the title. The `icon` prop should be a component that accepts a `size` prop.
 *
 * Another optional prop is `actionMenu` which can be any ReactNode to be displayed alongside the title.
 *
 * Depending on the `variant` prop, the component renders different styles and layouts.
